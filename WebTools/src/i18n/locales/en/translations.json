    "CareerType.klingon.veteran.name": "Veteran Warrior",
    "CareerType.klingon.veteran.description": "The character has decades of experience in the service of the Empire, and has served on many ships and space stations. The character’s judgement and opinions are highly regarded by subordinates, peers, and even superiors.",
    "CareerType.klingon.veteran.valueInstruction": "The character receives a Value, which must reflect the character’s years of experience and the beliefs they’ve formed over their long career.",

    "CareerType.solo.young.name": "Novice",
    "CareerType.solo.young.description": "Your character is defined by their potential more than their skill. Their raw talent and their expectations of what the universe is like has not yet been tempered by reality.",

    "Environment.common.homeworld.name": "Homeworld",
    "Environment.common.homeworld.description": "The character comes from the world that birthed their civilization, and has been surrounded by cultural and spiritual legacies their entire life. Species homeworlds are often utopian and idyllic, serving as the platonic ideal of that species’ culture. They also exemplify aspects of a culture’s most revered traditions, and serve as the heart of that civilization’s legal and political landscape.",

    "Environment.common.busyColony.name": "Busy Colony",
    "Environment.common.busyColony.description": "The character comes from one of their culture’s oldest or most prosperous colonies, which may be another world within their home system — such as Luna or Mars for Humans — or one of the first worlds colonized after the culture achieved interstellar flight. These colonies often develop a fiercely independent outlook, often having developed with little direct aid from their homeworld, and a sense of pride that accompanies being amongst the first of their kind to tame another world.",

    "Environment.common.isolatedColony.name": "Isolated Colony",
    "Environment.common.isolatedColony.description": "The character comes from a colony that is isolated from broader galactic society. Worlds like the Vulcan monastery on P’Jem use the vast distances between star systems as an opportunity for contemplative isolation, while others are settled because they present unique research opportunities. The cultures of these colonies tend to focus on learning and introspection.",

    "Environment.common.frontierColony.name": "Frontier Colony",
    "Environment.common.frontierColony.description": "The character comes from a colony located on the fringes of known space, either on the edge of uncharted space or on the border with another civilization. Frontier colonists tend to be hardy and determined, even stubborn, and well-prepared for the dangers that their home may pose.",

    "Environment.common.starshipOrStarbase.name": "Starship or Starbase",
    "Environment.common.starshipOrStarbase.description": "The character grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or living aboard a space station or starbase. While they’re unlikely to have lived aboard a Starfleet vessel — only some of them carry families — many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a tradition of family or generational crews, and many officers with families take postings to starbases rather than ships. Those raised in space learn the ins-and-outs of shipboard life as children, and many are groomed for leadership, or learn to fly a shuttle in their formative years.",

    "Environment.common.anotherSpeciesWorld.name": "Another Species' World",
    "Environment.common.anotherSpeciesWorld.description": "The character grew up amongst another species. They might have lived amongst a small enclave of their own kind, or they may have been orphaned by some manner of disaster and raised by aliens. Whatever the situation, the character has unique perspectives on their own species and on those they were raised alongside.",

    "Environment.klingon.homeworld.name": "Qo'noS",
    "Environment.klingon.homeworld.description": "You hail from the Klingon homeworld of Qo’noS, often called Kronos by outsiders, and you’ve been surrounded by the cultural and spiritual legacies of Kahless and the Empire for your entire life. The oldest and most revered of Klingon traditions came from your homeworld, and they are a defining part of your upbringing.",

    "Environment.klingon.busyColony.name": "Busy Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.busyColony.description": "You come from one of the Empire’s oldest or most prosperous colonies. These colonies often have a fiercely independent outlook, having developed with little aid from the Empire in their earliest days, and the pride that accompanies being amongst the first of their kind to tame an alien world still remains in the descendants of those first settlers.",

    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.name": "Isolated Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.isolatedColony.description": "You come from a colony isolated from the rest of the Empire, and from the wider Galaxy. Worlds like Boreth use this isolation as an opportunity for spirituality and contemplation, while others are settled because they present unique opportunities to perform research far from the scrutiny and politicking of the core worlds. Even in the Empire, these worlds emphasize learning and introspection.",

    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.name": "Frontier Colony",
    "Environment.klingon.frontierColony.description": "You come from a colony located on the fringes of the Empire, either on the edge of explored space or on the border with the Federation or the Romulan Empire. Your world may even have been claimed from one of those rival powers during a conflict in previous generations. Frontier colonies tend to produce determined people, stubborn and well-prepared for the dangers their home may present, and entirely willing to fight to keep what they have settled.",

    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.name": "Starship or Starbase",
    "Environment.klingon.starshipOrStarbase.description": "You grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or living aboard a space station. You won’t have been raised aboard a warship, but many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a tradition of family or generational crews. Those raised in space learn the ways of shipboard life as children, and many take to a spacefaring life easily as a result.",

    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.name": "Another Species' World",
    "Environment.klingon.anotherSpeciesWorld.description": "You grew up amongst non-Klingons. Perhaps you were part of a Klingon enclave overseeing a conquered world, or you were raised amongst exiles, or orphaned during a battle or disaster and raised by aliens. You might have been raised in the Empire, or you may be an outsider to it. Whatever the situation, you have chosen to serve the Empire and prove that you are as Klingon as anyone born on Qo’noS, even if you may have different perspectives on Klingon culture and tradition.",

    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.name": "Utopian Paradise",
    "Environment.alternate.utopianParadise.description": "You were raised in an environment of peace, prosperity, and abundance. There was no war on your world, nor any poverty, homelessness, hunger, or crime. You knew of those things only from studies of history and you have never really been able to understand how a society could produce such destructive inequality. You have always had access to the resources to not merely survive, but to thrive in whatever endeavors you chose to pursue.",

    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.name": "Cosmopolitan",
    "Environment.alternate.cosmopolitan.description": "You were raised in environments of trade or diplomacy, and the intermingling of different communities and cultures. The unfamiliar has always been familiar to you, and you had become familiar with dozens of cultures from distant worlds long before you were an adult. The frenetic pace of life and the basic need to revel in differences between groups and individuals have stayed with you as simple facts of existence in this big Galaxy.",

    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.name": "Rigorous Discipline",
    "Environment.alternate.rigorousDiscipline.description": "You have always been surrounded by notions of duty and purpose, and your childhood was a strict one, aimed at preparing you to take on a specific role or to achieve a specific goal. This meant relatively little personal freedom, but it instilled within you a powerful sense of what you were capable of when pushed to succeed.",

    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.name": "Ascetism and Introspection",
    "Environment.alternate.ascetismAndIntrospection.description": "Your life was a simple one, lacking in many of the luxuries that prosperous worlds take for granted. This was not because of a lack, but rather a choice – a belief amongst those you grew up with that external and material abundance can distract from self-knowledge and personal growth.",

    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.name": "Struggle and Hardship",
    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.description": "For one reason or another, your world was one with few available resources. Worlds on the frontier, as well as isolated outposts, are often places of hardship where continued survival is difficult, while other worlds struggle in the wake of natural or ecological disasters, the aftermath of war, or societal collapse that leaves basic infrastructure in ruins. Some seek out worlds such as this, where “honest toil” is held as a virtue, while others find themselves in lives of daily struggle through no choice of their own and seek to either better their world or escape it.",

    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.name": "Occupation or War",
    "Environment.alternate.occupationOrWar.description": "Though the Federation’s members no longer war amongst themselves, warfare is still a part of the Galaxy. Local or planetary conflicts afflict many independent worlds, and interstellar conflicts ranging from border skirmishes to sector-spanning wars are something which all civilizations must prepare to face. Worlds ravaged by war, or even occupied by a hostile nation, are difficult places to live, often forcing people to adapt to horrific conditions and life-or-death decisions.",

    "Species.aenar.name": "Aenar",
    "Species.aenar.description": "The Aenar subspecies of the Andorians is native to the Northern Wastes of Andoria. Their population never rose above a few thousand. Prior to the 23rd- Century, Aenar lived in an underground compound shielded by a dampening field, and had become a myth to other Andorians. They have a communal society with no formal leader, but when the situation calls for a single voice they appoint a delegate known as “The Speaker.” Aenar possess a strictly pacifist ideology and deplore violence of all forms, both physical and mental. \n\nPhysiologically, Aenar are almost identical to Andorians save an absence of skin and hair pigmentation and their highly evolved telepathic abilities, but the Aenar had a strict law against reading the minds of other people without prior consent. Aenar and Andorians were genetically compatible, and following their discovery in 2140, there were increasing marriages between the subspecies. By the early 24th-Century, few Aenar remained, having become fully integrated into Andorian society. However, it was not unknown for families with many Aenar progenitors to produce children with empathy talents.",
    "Species.aenar.exampleValue": "There is never a need for hostility",
    "Species.aenar.soloDescription": "The Aenar were a subspecies of Andorians who were on the verge of extinction by the mid-22nd century. They had two antennae and no skin or hair pigmentation. Their most distinctive trait was their telepathic abilities, which included reading minds and psychically projecting themselves into the minds of other humanoids.",
    "Species.aenar.trait": "Andorian, Aenar",
    "Species.aenar.traitDescription": "These traits may reduce the Difficulty of Tasks to resist extreme cold, or Tasks impacted by extremely low temperatures. Their antennae aids in both balance and spatial awareness, and a lost or injured antenna causes dizziness until it regrows. Andorians have a high metabolism that means they tire quickly and are more vulnerable to infection from certain types of injury. Many Aenar are born blind yet have the ability to “see” people and objects via their innate telepathy. However, operating terminals or using view screens is more challenging.",

    "Species.andorian.name": "Andorian",
    "Species.andorian.aboutNames": "Andorian names tend to be somewhat harsh-sounding, and have a personal name followed by a clan name. Amongst some Andorians, it’s common to begin the clan name with a gender-specific prefix: 'zh' or 'sh' for females, and 'ch' or 'th' for males. This is placed before the family name, separated by an apostrophe. Longer or more complicated Andorian names are commonly shortened, especially when dealing with other species. Examples: Ishrelia zh’Azonan (female), Atheth th’Zynes(male)",
    "Species.andorian.description": "An aggressive, passionate people from the frozen moon Andoria, the Andorians have been part of the United Federation of Planets since its foundation, having been firm allies of Humanity for several years beforehand.

    "Species.andorian.soloDescription": "An aggressive, passionate people from a frozen moon. Founding member of the Federation. Blue-skinned, pale-haired in appearance, with antennae. Their antennae aid in balance and spatial awareness; a lost antenna can be debilitating until it regrows.

    "Species.aquan.aboutNames": "Aquan names are typically a single word composed of just a few syllables.",
    "Species.aquan.description": "The humanoid, water-breathing Aquans were transformed indigenous inhabitants of the planet Argo. They had green skin, flat noses, hair resembling kelp, webbed hands, and fins on their ankles. Argo was once mostly land, but planetary-wide seismic disturbances caused the land to gradually sink into the sea. Though not everyone chose the procedure, the medically advanced Aquans developed drugs to turn themselves into an aquatic species. Although they had the means to reverse the transformation, once they became water breathers, they chose to forget their past and construct a new society beneath the sea.\n\nThe reversal formula was lost to time, and the remaining air breathers were seen as enemies. Among the water-breathing Aquans’ many medical talents were the manipulation and erasure of memories, which they used on their enemies.\n\nIn 2269, the _Enterprise_ was studying Argo, unaware of any intelligent life on the planet, when a catastrophic seaquake put Kirk and Spock in peril of drowning.\n\nFortunately, they were saved by some of the Aquans and transformed into sea-breathers. With the help of the Aquans, they were able to find a way to reverse the transformation, and some younger Aquans chose to also use the drug so they could experience life on the surface of their world.\n\nToday, both groups of Aquans live in peace on Argo, and within a year of first contact, a handful of Aquans, both air and water breathers, joined Starfleet.",
    "Species.aquan.exampleValue": "Air breathers rarely come in peace",
    "Species.aquan.traitDescription": "Aquans are water breathers and expert swimmers who spend their lives in underwater environments. However, it is possible for them to transform into air breathers if they have access to the reversal formula rediscovered by the Enterprise crew.",

    "Species.arbazan.name": "Arbazan",
    "Species.arbazan.soloDescription": "Like many Humanoid species within the Federation, the Arbazan are physically similar to Humans, though the forward portion of their skulls have slightly raised plates that reinforce their brows. Arbazan have been Federation members since shortly after its founding and are found throughout Federation space, often serving as ambassadors, attaches, advisors, and negotiators – though there have also been several well-known scientific discoveries and engineering advancements by dedicated Arbazan.",

Examples: Reil Yesa (female), Latara Gel (male)",
    "Species.bajoran.description": "A spiritual, dauntless people from the planet Bajor, the Bajorans have lost much after decades of occupation by the Cardassian Union. Many Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant during the occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often acted as insurgents or toiled in labor camps under Cardassian rule. The occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet. Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets, celestial beings who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia; modern religious doctrine states that the Bajoran Wormhole is the Prophets’ Celestial Temple.",
    "Species.bajoran.exampleValue": "Faith in the Prophets",
    "Species.bajoran.soloDescription": "A spiritual, dauntless people who suffered under Cardassian occupation. They worship celestial beings residing in the Bajoran wormhole. They are much like Humans in appearance, with nose ridges and often wear an elaborate earring on their right ear.",
    "Species.bajoran.traitDescription": "For obvious reasons, Bajorans tend to be hostile towards Cardassians, and resentful of those who are dismissive of, or turned a blind eye to, the suffering of the Bajoran people.

    "Species.betazoid.name": "Betazoid",
    "Species.betazoid.aboutNames": "Betazoid names tend to have at least two syllables and a melodic sound, with a personal name followed by a family name; of these, the family name tends to have a harder sound. Betazoids are traditionally matriarchal, with children taking their mother’s family name.",
    "Species.betazoid.description": "The peaceful Betazoid people hail from the idyllic, verdant world Betazed. The world is a valued member of the Federation, and its people can be found across Federation space, including Starfleet. Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans, but differ in one major way: they are naturally telepathic, developing mental abilities during adolescence. The potency of this ability varies between individuals, but it has resulted in a culture where honesty and directness are fundamental: it is difficult to keep secrets when everyone around you can read minds.",
    "Species.betazoid.exampleValue": "Compassion Through Understanding",

All Betazoids are telepathic to varying degrees, and even when not actively using their abilities, they are highly perceptive of others around them, but also sensitive to telepathic disturbances and mental assaults. They have little familiarity with lies and deception, due to their open culture and ability to read the thoughts and emotions of others. As they are sensitive to the minds of other living beings, they tend not to be comfortable around animals, for fear of losing themselves in the minds of wild creatures.",

    "Species.bynar.name": "Bynar",
    "Species.bynar.exampleValue": "There are only ever two choices",
    "Species.bynar.description": "Bynars are native to the planet Bynaus, in the Beta Magellan system. Shorter than Humans, Bynars have lilac-coloured skin, enlarged skulls, and asymmetrical ears. Their defining characteristic is that the entire Bynar race is cyborgs connected to their master computer on their homeworld, allowing them to near-instantaneously share information. Bynars work and live in pairs, being genetically bonded to another for life. Pairs of Bynars communicate using complex binary code. When they do speak other languages, they alternate phrases and finishing each other’s sentences. If one of the pair dies, it’s traditional for the survivor to return to Bynaus to be paired with a new Bynar. \n\nBynar that choose not to return are seen to have rejected Bynar society and have their personal identification code removed from the computer network. The Bynars’ constant exposure to computers makes them quick to learn new operating systems and programs, and their ability to recall data and process new information makes them highly valued to organizations such as the Starfleet Corps of Engineers and the Daystrom Institute. \n\nBynars have practiced their cybernetic augmentation for centuries: as early as the 2150s they began replacing the parietal lobes of newborns with a synaptic processor. Bynar workers and security forces once employed supplementary physical augmentations, but these have become rare since Bynaus allied with the Federation. Initially, Bynars seldom traveled far from their homeworld, as the range of their network was limited. By the late 2200s, subspace  communication had improved enough that they could travel throughout much of the Federation.",
    "Species.bynar.soloDescription": "Over time their interconnection with their world’s master computer has grown to the point that their language and thought patterns have become as close to binary as is possible for organic beings. In fact, their very lives depend on this interaction with their master computer, as well as with one another. They are shorter in height than most humanoids, genderless with lilac skin and enlarged skulls, and usually operate in pairs.",
    "Species.bynar.traitDescription": "Despite their small size, Bynars are physical robust and durable. Their augmentations allow them to communicate instantaneously with their twin while in the same system, sharing all sensory input. However, they are vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses, which can disable or destroy their implants, leaving them disoriented or even disabled.",

    "Species.changeling.name": "Changeling",
    "Species.changeling.soloDescription": "A Changeling is naturally a gelatinous, morphogenic, orange-brown fluid, which can adopt the form and structure of any solid object, including other living creatures and diffuse substances like fog. While they cannot become energy, a Changeling’s ability to assume other forms is limited more by skill and experience than by physical capacity: it is theorized that they transfer mass to and from subspace to change size and density. Many Changelings find themselves persecuted by “solids” for their shapeshifting ability, and often crave a sense of order and justice in the universe, with a rigid attitude at odds with their fluid forms.",

    "Species.chelon.name": "Rigellian Chelon",

    "Species.deltan.name": "Deltan",
    "Species.deltan.soloDescription": "Deltans are beautiful individuals, with powerful empathic abilities and heightened sensuality.

    "Species.denobulan.name": "Denobulan",
    "Species.denobulan.aboutNames": "Denobulans tend to only have a single name — an individual Denobulan may be part of several overlapping families.

Some El-Aurians had even visited Earth during the 19th century before humanity even knew of their existence. In the mid-23rd century, the El-Aurian race was the victim of a massive Borg invasion, with all but a small fraction of El-Aurians being assimilated or killed and the entire civilization destroyed. The loss of their home world scattered the survivors across the galaxy. By the 24th century few El-Aurians remain and with no established civilization or home wander as nomads of the galaxy. Few of these survivors have even taken up a career in Starfleet, hoping to find a community they lost so long ago.",
    "Species.elAurian.exampleValue": "I told you, I listen",
    "Species.elAurian.traitDescription": "This species are masters of the art of listening. They understand that listening is an active skill, and involves taking into consideration such things as body language, tone of voice, as well as the words that other beings are speaking.

    "Species.gorn.name": "Gorn",
    "Species.gorn.soloDescription": "Gorn are large and powerfully-built, even more so than other famously-mighty species such as the Klingons or Nausicaans. They are many times stronger than a Human being, and resilient enough to ignore massive blunt force trauma or even short periods in hard vacuum. However, Gorn are not especially agile or fast. Gorn are ectothermic – cold- blooded – with their body temperature varying by external factors, and thus favor warm environments where they can be most active and effective.",

    "Species.hologram.name": "Hologram",
    "Species.hologram.soloDescription": "Holograms can be programmed to any specification, though the nature of their holomatrix means that they are essentially impervious to direct physical harm – they can allow energy and objects to pass through them at will. However, they are unable to go anywhere that lacks holographic emitters that can project their image and forcefields, and those emitters can be damaged even if the holograms themselves cannot. Holograms also tend not to receive much respect or consideration from flesh- and-blood people, who may see them as tools at best or annoyances at worst. While the majority of holograms are no more sentient than a character in a holo-novel, under the right circumstances, they can become self-aware and deserve the same rights as any biological sentient life-form.

Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.",
    "Species.human.exampleValue": "The Drive for Exploration",

    "Species.pandronian.description": "Pandronians are one of the most surreal sentient beings the Federation has ever encountered. They have the appearance of a light-green-skinned humanoid, but each Pandronian is actually three creatures in one, existing as a cooperative group of distinct organisms. The organisms that make up a Pandronian colony can change over time, merging with other colonies and ending the existence of the previous colony, creating new, unique Pandronians. They are, in some way, like Trill symbionts, with colony members taking the knowledge of former colonies with them when they form new unity.\n\nThe concept of individuality holds an idiosyncratic meaning for a Pandronian. In language, this is expressed by using “this one” instead of “I.” Many Pandronians see single-entity beings as inferior and may appear cold and arrogant, but while disagreeable, they are not dangerous, abhorring violence and finding it a moral failing. Even in self-defense, they would rather ‘disassemble unity’ than fight.\n\nOutside of Pandronian cities is a vast jungle of constantly changing colony creatures, some quite dangerous. Consequently, Pandronians don’t travel at night or go far from home. This is so deeply ingrained it follows a Pandronian off-planet.",

Their bodies consist of a series of furry, vine-like extensions that are bunched near the bottom and equipped with four leg-like projections for movement.\n\nCommunication is accomplished with the help of a device called a voder which interprets the low- frequency sound waves their veins make. They can communicate with other Phylosians without the voder and at great distances when on the ground.\n\nPhylosians can be long-lived and, like the great redwood trees of Earth, can grow very tall (up to 8 meters or more). However, if living in a confined area, such as a starship, that growth is stunted.\n\nAll of Phylos has been greatly influenced by Stavos Keniclius, a 21st-century Augment who inadvertently triggered a staphylococcus plague when he arrived on the planet, significantly damaging the planet’s ecosystem and nearly annihilating the Phylosian civilization. Despite that tragedy, they remained peaceful.\n\nAs of 2270, a few Phylosians had already joined Starfleet as experts in exobotany and medicine.",

    "Species.skorr.name": "Skorr",
    "Species.skorr.aboutNames": "Skorr individuals usually go by a single name.",
    "Species.skorr.description": "Bipedal avians with feathered wings, the Skorr was a splinter group of Aurelians that left their planet nearly a millennia ago to pursue a warrior way of life, pitting clan against clan.\n\nDue to their limited genetic population, the Skorr relied on cloning in their early history to support reproduction. This eventually led to the Skorr military’s ability to rapidly produce large armies. Extraordinarily long-lived, they also have an extraordinarily short childhood, reaching the equivalent of a Terran teenager in only two years.\n\nAround the time Zefram Cochran was discovering warp drive, a Skorr spiritual leader named Alar led his people into an era of peace. Before he died, his brain patterns were imprinted into a piece of sculpture called “The Soul of Alar.” Not unlike a Vulcan Katric ark, it allowed others to experience his essence, keeping the literal spirit of peace alive.\n\nTwo hundred years later, the peace had held and opened the doors for their entry into the Federation. In 2270, they were close to reunification with Aurelia.",
    "Species.skorr.exampleValue": "Alar is our salvation and our teacher",
    "Species.skorr.traitDescription": "The Skorr possess beaks and talons as well as powerful wings that grant them the ability to fly, a result of their ornithoid ancestry. Additionally, their intellects are as sharp as their talons.",

    "Species.suliban.name": "Suliban",
    "Species.suliban.description": "The Sulibans’ distinguishing physical characteristic is their mottled, greenish-tinted skin. Most of them are nomadic. One faction of Suliban are members of the Cabal and can alter their DNA and restructure their skeletons, giving them unique chameleon-like, shapeshifting abilities and enhanced senses.",

    "Species.talarian.name": "Talarian",
    "Species.talarian.aboutNames": "Talarian names are usually short, but have a less gruff or rugged sound than most words in their language. The names Endar and Jono are good examples of Talarian nomenclature.",
    "Species.talarian.description": "Talarians are a Xenophobic species, & will normally wear gloves when in the company of other species to avoid touching an \"alien\" directly. Removing the gloves & touching someone with the bare hands is a sign of affection and respect. Bowing is considered a sign of respect, affection and solidarity. When meeting a close person, the bowing is extended by touching arms & gently pressing foreheads.",
    "Species.talarian.exampleValue": "Constantly testing one's capabilities promotes strength.",
    "Species.talarian.traitDescription": "Talarians are characterized by a distinctive hairless enlargement of the coronal area of the skull extending in 2 lobes to the back of the head. Talarian blood is red, & Talarians are prone to radiation burns & respiratory distress. Otherwise their physique is very similar to humans & Human/Talarian hybrids are possible without too many complications.",

    "Species.tellarite.name": "Tellarite",
    "Species.tellarite.aboutNames": "Tellarite names have considerable variation, but all tend to be composed of harsh, even guttural sounds. Tellarite names consist of a personal name and a family name, though the family name is often a compound, indicating that the family name is a patronym or matronym (the name of a father or mother, respectively), toponym(derived from a place) or similar — in this way, these prefixes are similar to “O’”, “Mc“, “von”, and similar elements in some Human names. Examples: Pola jav Brin (female), Tuk glasch Khutohk (male)",
    "Species.tellarite.description": "The stout, hirsute Tellarite species comes from Tellar Prime, a temperate planet in the Alpha Quadrant. Theirs is a culture noted for being abrasive and argumentative, with a stubborn pride, quick tempers, and little patience. However, this is only a superficial view: while Tellarites are argumentative, it comes from a sense of intellectual honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept, or person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and tend to greet one another with criticisms, complaints, and even insults; failing to respond in kind is poorly- regarded, as it displays a weakness of character and an unwillingness to confront flaws.",
    "Species.tellarite.exampleValue": "All Ideas must Withstand Scrutiny",
    "Species.tellarite.traitDescription": "Tellarites have a keen sense of smell and a high tolerance for many common drugs, toxins, and inebriants (Tellarites don’t get drunk, just feisty). They also have excellent eyesight, and more acute perception of distance, depth, and dimension than Humans.",

    "Species.trill.name": "Trill",
    "Species.trill.aboutNames": "Trill names consist of a personal name and a family name, though in the case of a joined Trill, the family name is replaced with the name of the symbiont. Examples: Koria Inazin (female, unjoined), Bejal Okir (male, joined)",
    "Species.trill.description": "The Trill species, from their homeworld of the same name, appear almost identical to Humans, but for rows of spots running down the sides of their bodies, from head to toe. However, this superficial similarity conceals a considerable difference — the Trill are capable of bonding with a symbiotic organism known as a symbiont, creating a distinct being from the two individual creatures. The symbionts can live for many centuries, and are placed with successive hosts, carrying the memories and knowledge of previous hosts into a new joining with each new generation. This fact isn’t widely known outside the Trill themselves, but it isn’t a secret — it simply isn’t widely discussed, and the number of joined Trill is relatively small. The Trill have been part of the Federation for well over a century, with several renowned Trill serving important roles in shaping the Federation. The Trill, as a culture, tend to be focused on intellectual pursuits first and foremost, as learning and wisdom are prized by the symbionts in their hosts.",
    "Species.trill.exampleValue": "Four Lifetimes of Adventure",
    "Species.trill.traitDescription": "Trill are especially resilient to parasites, as a quirk of their potential to be Joined; Joined Trill are entirely immune to parasitic infection. However, they tend to have strong allergic reactions to insect bites and other forms of venom, which can disrupt their neurochemistry, particularly if they’re Joined. As many of the specifics of Trill physiology — especially with regards to symbiosis — are not widely known, this can result in medical complications.",

    "Species.vulcan.name": "Vulcan",
    "Species.vulcan.aboutNames": "Vulcans have only a single name, in practical terms — while they do have family names, these are not discussed amongst other species — and tend to be traditional in the names they use. Male Vulcans often — though far from always — are given names beginning with S, while female names frequently begin with T. These are far from universal, however.",
    "Species.vulcan.description": "The Vulcans are a stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, in truth the Vulcans feel deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Their stoicism comes from a culture of logic and self- discipline, where emotions are analyzed and dissected to rob them of their potency, so that they cannot overwhelm or control the individual. Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst outsiders.",
    "Species.vulcan.exampleValue": "The Needs of the Many Outweighs the Needs of the Few, or the One",
    "Species.vulcan.traitDescription": "Due to the harsh, arid, high-gravity world they come from, Vulcans are naturally resistant to extreme heat and dehydration; they are also extremely strong, with keen auditory and olfactory senses. They are also telepathic, though this takes training to properly manifest, and they learn mental discipline and emotional control from childhood. However, this control takes regular meditation to maintain, and their controlled nature and desire for privacy can distance them from others, and make interactions awkward.",

    "Species.yridian.traitDescription": "The Yridians are usually bald, but some have dark, curly hair. They have a wrinkly appearance, with rodent-like ears and small eyes and noses. They have a ridge running from their nose, up and over their heads. Most are thumbless and have only four fingers on each hand, but some have thumbs. They are often devious and untrustworthy.",
    "Species.yridian.description": "Yridians are often free agents working with those who share their personal goals, or as hired hands for other species. They are known to be traders, smugglers and information merchants, and are unwilling to part with information without payment. They were believed to be extinct until the mid-2360s until the Federation made first contact. They use disruptor weaponry.",
