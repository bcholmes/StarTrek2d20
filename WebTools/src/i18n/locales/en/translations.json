    "Environment.alternate.struggleAndHardship.description": "For one reason or another, your world was one with few available resources. Worlds on the frontier, as well as isolated outposts, are often places of hardship where continued survival is difficult, while other worlds struggle in the wake of natural or ecological disasters, the aftermath of war, or societal collapse that leaves basic infrastructure in ruins. Some seek out worlds such as this, where “honest toil” is held as a virtue, while others find themselves in lives of daily struggle through no choice of their own and seek to either better their world or escape it.",

    "Spaceframe.akira": "Akira Class",

    "Spaceframe.akira.description": "In the aftermath of the Battle of Wolf 359, Starfleet saw the need for a heavily armed and combat-capable starship that could perform patrol assignments and maintain a constant presence in a sector of space to provide support or direct action in combat assignments, but still be able to contribute to the primary goal of Starfleet in exploration and discovery. The design that the Advanced Starship Design Bureau chose for this project was one that had been first proposed in the mid-23rd century, but technological limitations prevented its proper construction until then. When updated with the latest technologies, the new U.S.S. Akira was so successful in its initial patrols that Starfleet immediately ordered the class into wide production.",

    "Spaceframe.ambassador": "Ambassador Class",

    "Spaceframe.ambassador.description": "The Starfleet Exploratory Division and the Federation Science Council began to see a steady decline in scientific returns from deep space missions by the beginning of the 24th century. Starfleet had been relying on Excelsior-class and the few Constitution-class starships still in service to continue its aims of discovery, but even with the planned refits of those spaceframes, they still required visits to logistical hubs every five years as systems wore down. Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards began to develop a new deep-space exploration cruiser that would address these concerns and allow a spaceframe to go deeper into the unknown. The Ambassador class was developed and launched in 2335, and many of the engineering techniques, design ideas, and technologies created for this starship would continue to be refined over the coming decades and become the basis for the Galaxy class.",

    "Spaceframe.archer": "Archer Class",

    "Spaceframe.archer.description": "The Archer class was designed to be a next-generation pathfinder, intended for long-range scouting missions and for pushing the boundaries of the Federation out farther and faster than any other Starfleet ship class. The class’s design team benefitted from the research gained via more than a decade’s worth of technological advances installed on Constitution, Hermes, Ptolemy, and Saladin class vessels, resulting in the Archer-class boasting some of the most advanced impulse drives and RCS thruster suites yet installed on a Starfleet vessel. The ship’s design is compact, consisting of a three-deck primary hull containing all ship systems save for the two outboard warp nacelles connected by short struts to the primary hull. Archer class vessels would continue in service until the mid-24th century when Danube-class runabouts began to take over the roles they once filled.",

    "Spaceframe.california": "California Class",

    "Spaceframe.california.description": "As the Federation rapidly spread across the Orion Spur in the 2350s, Starfleet was seeing a lack of vessels able to respond to needs of all kinds inside the borders of the polity. Starfleet opened up the possibility for member worlds to design and build their own starship class to be able to respond to issues they felt were pressing to their own colonies and interests. Earth presented the California class based on already standardized Starfleet designs, but with features that were Earth specific, and would go on to influence the Galaxy-class starships of the next decade. California-class vessels were seen as dependable workhorses, but were never built in numbers comparable to Excelsior- and Miranda-class vessels, making them rarely seen outside of Human and cetacean dominated volumes of the Federation. They continued to be used by Starfleet in front line roles until the mid-25th century when they were slowly phased into civilian use.",

    "Spaceframe.cardenas": "Cardenas Class",

    "Spaceframe.cardenas.description": "The successes seen in the other classes resulting from Operation Next Step gave the Admiralty hope that other ideas that had been proposed in the first years of the project could be expanded upon and fully realized. One such concept was a “rapid response frigate” that was the same dimensions as the earlier Next Step designs. With the Federation quickly expanding across the Orion Arm, the Cardenas-class design only went through a single revision phase, with many of the initial engineering problems being worked out as the first spaceframes were being constructed. \n\nThe Cardenas class became one of the more prestigious postings a person could gain in the early 23rd century. The speed that it was designed to utilize not only saw the vessel being dispatched to star systems along the Klingon and Romulan Neutral Zones for intercepts or chasing sensor shadows, but the vessel was also used as a high-speed explorer. As this class was highly specialized with its warp propulsion systems, refitting the spaceframe proved to be time consuming, resulting in this class spending almost double the amount of time in dry dock compared to other vessels of similar displacement. This issue compounded itself with the development of duotronic computers in the early 2240s. \n\nBy 2245 the vast majority of Cardenas-class vessels were out of active service and undergoing service or refit. The launch of the Constitution-class vessel would bring the end of these vessels, and Starfleet would allow the spaceframes currently undergoing refit to continue, but would order the rest of the vessels to be mothballed. The last active Cardenas class, U.S.S. Van Allen, retired in 2263.",

    "Spaceframe.centaur": "Centaur Class",

    "Spaceframe.centaur.description": "In the mid-2280s, Starfleet felt that the next generation of light cruisers should begin development based on the new technologies being developed in tandem for the Excelsior class. The failures of the prototype transwarp systems in the Excelsior class meant delays for the light cruiser, then named the Centaur class. Extensive redesigns of most systems were undertaken by the mid-2290s, with additional vessels of the class beyond the prototype coming into service. Externally this class resembles the Excelsior class in many regards, including sharing the same saucer for its primary hull and elongated transwarp-style nacelles. Not as modular and mission-customizable as the Miranda class, the Centaur class would only be produced in small numbers, and was seen as a specialist vessel during an age when multipurpose vessels were in ascendancy in Starfleet Command.",

    "Spaceframe.constellation": "Constellation Class",

    "Spaceframe.constellation.description": "The Constellation class was developed in the mid 2280s as both a response to increasing tension with the Klingon Empire and to the difficulties in the development of the new transwarp system for Excelsior-class vessels. The vessel was never intended as a warship of the kind used by the Empire, nor did it have as much weaponry as a fully-armed Miranda-class ship, but Constellation-class vessels were intended to be able to intercept incursions from the Empire at high warp speeds and survive until heavier reinforcements could arrive. This class’s intended use would never occur, as the Khitomer Accords were signed soon after the class’s widespread deployment. Instead of being taken out of service or redeployed, Constellation-class vessels were given different assignments, acting as first responders to crises across the Federation and the unclaimed sectors surrounding its slowly expanding borders.",

    "Spaceframe.constitution": "Constitution Class",

    "Spaceframe.constitution.description": "The symbol of Starfleet in the mid-to-late 23rd century, the Constitution class would become legendary across the Orion Spur due to its five-year missions.\n\nConstruction of the vessels was accomplished primarily in the Sol system, but after the initial block of vessels was completed and the first five-year missions were at an end, spaceframes were manufactured in other core world systems capable of handling the large spaceframe. The Constitution class would become the testbed of new technologies in the early 2270s that were developed out of the same classes’ five-year missions and lessons learned from the brief war with the Klingon Empire. The spaceframe continued in service until the mid-24th century.",

    "Spaceframe.crossfield": "Crossfield Class",

    "Spaceframe.crossfield.description": "Designed and produced in secret, the Crossfield class was produced solely to test the theoretical “displacement-activated spore hub drive” developed by Doctors Paul Stamets and Justin Straal. The launch of U.S.S. Crossfield in 2255 was a success for starship research and development for Starfleet, but initial tests of the spore drive were  unsuccessful. By early 2256, these flaws in the drive system were ironed out and the spaceframes were launched just prior to the outbreak of hostilities with the Klingon Empire.\n\nWith the limited number of spaceframes produced and the loss of both Glenn and Discovery to drive failures in 2256 and 2258 respectively, only U.S.S. Crossfield was left in service, and further spaceframes had their production canceled. Crossfield herself would continue in service with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers until a collision with a sizable piece of an asteroid rendered the vessel unsalvageable after being towed back to Spacedock in 2273. It remained there in use as a testbed for new technologies until it was finally broken up in 2290.",

    "Spaceframe.daedalus": "Daedalus Class",

    "Spaceframe.daedalus.description": "The Daedalus class served Starfleet as its primary patrol, colony support, and exploration craft prior to the introduction of the N X class. The rapidly expanding influence of United Earth meant the construction of these spaceframes had to occur at a rapid pace, meaning that these vessels were built with the lowest amount of advanced technology as  possible, as well as systems that would require little from shipyards for maintenance. The success of this class during the Earth-Romulan War, and its amazing adaptability, meant that it would continue to serve actively in Starfleet into the mid-23rd century, and in civilian support roles into the late 24th century.",

    "Spaceframe.defiant": "Defiant Class",

    "Spaceframe.defiant.description": "As Starfleet had little experience in designing a warship from the ground up, the development of the Defiant class began before the destruction of the fleet at Wolf 359 by the Borg in 2367, and wouldn’t see the construction of the first spaceframe until 2371 – and only then after delays and massive redesigns, as new technology was developed to fight the Borg.",

    "Spaceframe.engle": "Engle Class",

    "Spaceframe.engle.description": "The Engle class had gone so far as to have an experimental spaceframe constructed in 2208, and was finally finished with the advent of newer warp coil designs in 2224. Fast classes of starships such as the Cardenas class were useful, but required large amounts of material to produce, as well as significant amounts of energy to maintain a stable warp field. The Engle class was smaller, and required a much smaller warp core to maintain high velocities and a stable field.\n\nThe spaceframe proved to be popular for new member worlds of the Federation to request Starfleet to build at their shipyards due to its speed and size. During the 2230s and 40s many of the first Starfleet vessels to be assigned to a newly admitted or colonized world were Engles.\n\nEngle-class vessels were relegated to Starfleet Medical as emergency response ships and kept in active service in that role until the late 2290s.",

    "Spaceframe.excelsior": "Excelsior Class",

    "Spaceframe.excelsior.description": "What was originally intended as a testbed for the highly experimental “transwarp” propulsion system, the “Great Experiment” was seen as a disaster after the complete failure of Excelsior’s propulsion systems in 2285. After a total redesign was performed on nearly all ship’s systems, the transwarp propulsion was replaced with standard warp propulsion. The versatile Excelsior spaceframe became a standard sight across the Federation and beyond, and continues to be manufactured into the 2390s.",

    "Spaceframe.gagarin": "Gagarin Class",

    "Spaceframe.gagarin.description": "The latter decades of the 24th century were tumultuous. The difficult political climate gave rise to a faction of hawks in Starfleet who insisted that deterrence was an important tool. If new war did come, Starfleet would need starships capable of engaging new adversaries. The Gagarin-class battlecruiser is one of several designs ordered by a Starfleet shedding its isolationism and preparing to face a new century of uncertainty.",

    "Spaceframe.galaxy": "Galaxy Class",

    "Spaceframe.galaxy.description": "The Galaxy class was designed to surpass any exploration and science vessel ever developed by Starfleet, including the most advanced technologies of the 2350s. This spaceframe also represented a totally new philosophy for crew mental well-being on long duration, deep space assignments, as it saw Starfleet providing facilities and living quarters for civilian dependents and volunteers. The concept centered on not separating families from loved ones for years at a time, and the morale on Galaxy-class vessels was correspondingly high.",

    "Spaceframe.hermes": "Hermes Class",
    "Spaceframe.hiawatha": "Hiawatha Class",
    "Spaceframe.hoover": "Hoover Class",
    "Spaceframe.intrepid": "Intrepid Class",

    "Spaceframe.intrepid.description": "After a decade in service, Starfleet had seen the successes and failures of the Galaxy-class vessels then in service. As that large vessel was being used more as a diplomatic and command vessel than for exploration, Starfleet felt there was a need for a smaller and faster deep-space explorer. Containing the best technology of the early 2370s and evolved from the Nova class’s design and materials, the new Intrepid class was a symbol of the Federation Science Council’s intent to have Starfleet return to its stated goals of exploration and science. The Dominion War would reduce the number of hulls constructed, but the end of the war – and the return of U.S.S. Voyager to Federation space in 2378 – meant renewed passion for this spaceframe.",

    "Spaceframe.inquiry": "Inquiry Class",

    "Spaceframe.inquiry.description": "The technological renaissance for the Federation in the late 24th century produced giant strides forward in almost every aspect of life for its citizens, and Starfleet saw each of these as an opportunity to push its design philosophy forward. The success of the Vesta class had Starfleet attempting to build a more automated and adaptive spaceframe capable of using quantum slipstream, and to be as modular as the Nebula and Luna classes. It was determined that installing a QSD would require far too many crew members to operate, and instead focus was put upon improving the vessel’s sustained cruising velocity. The Inquiry-class exploration cruiser was the result, and began replacing Miranda-class vessels almost immediately. The first large-scale deployment of these vessels was the 1st Devron Heavy Response Squadron under the command of Captain Riker in 2399.",

    "Spaceframe.luna": "Luna Class",

    "Spaceframe.luna.description": "With the design success of the Intrepid class, Starfleet immediately began the parallel development of a heavy explorer capable of all the same exploratory and scientific assignments of an Intrepid class, but with larger research facilities, more computer processing power, and longer mission duration. The Luna class exited its design phase eight months after her sister class, and while there were engineering delays, U.S.S. Luna NX-80101 slipped her drydock over Mars in late 2372. Further delays occurred because of the outbreak of war between the Klingon Empire, and later, the Dominion. While the Luna class was approved for production, further vessels weren’t launched until 2375.",

    "Spaceframe.odyssey.description": "Following encounters with the massive starships fielded by the Borg, Dominion, and the Remans, Starfleet planners were concerned that the Federation’s heavy cruisers were falling behind the curve on defensive and offensive capability. In response, the Admiralty decided to invest in an ambitious design program. The goal was to create Starfleet’s own iteration of a massive “star cruiser” that could compete with these super-capital-class starships on a peer footing. The project would yield the U.S.S. Odyssey, the U.S.S. Verity, and eventually the next Starship Enterprise, NCC-1701-F. The Odyssey class would carry the Federation’s flag into the 25th century as a beacon of hope during a  tumultuous era.",

    "Spaceframe.osler": "Osler Class",
    "Spaceframe.parliament": "Parliament Class",
    "Spaceframe.pathfinder": "Pathfinder Class",

    "Spaceframe.pathfinder.description": "Starfleet’s order of battle has long emphasized the humble science vessel, to the point where many admiralty planners regularly complain that fleet resources are being misallocated given the recent belligerent political climate of the Galaxy. While the turn of the 25th century has certainly seen a shift in new construction away from pure research ships into cruisers and escorts, the Admiralty continues to pursue ways to build versatile starships that are useful as defense platforms but also excel at research and exploration. A sixth-generation example of Starfleet’s long-range science vessel, the Pathfinder’s namesake is the mission that helped bring the U.S.S. Voyager home 40 years ago.",

    "Spaceframe.reliant": "Reliant Class",

    "Spaceframe.reliant.description": "The Admiralty needed a replacement for the Miranda class that could serve as the backbone of Starfleet’s logistical and operational support corps. Unlike the Miranda, which began life as a long-range cruiser and transitioned to logistical and support duties as it became outclassed by newer constructions, the Reliant would be designed as a support ship from its inception. The Reliant was one of the first starship classes to fully embrace the “sixth generation” of Starfleet starship technology, featuring more automation, more versatile particle emitters and sensors, and a fast but limited quantum slipstream burst projector.",

    "Spaceframe.ross": "Ross Class",

    "Spaceframe.ross.description": "The Ross-class exploration cruiser is an evolution of the large, long-range explorer-type vessel, building on the successes of its Galaxy-class predecessor. The Ross is a product of a variety of important advancements in Starfleet’s tactical and computational systems that came about in the 2370s. The Admiralty envisioned the Ross as a complement to the Sovereign-class assault cruiser. In contrast to the Sovereign’s focus on combat performance and fleet command, the Ross used its extra tonnage to host a large suite of diplomatic quarters, crew-support facilities, science labs, and even an auxiliary warp core.",

It is a generational evolution from its Nebula-class predecessor and brings a selection of turn-of-the-century technologies to the long-range surveyor mission profile. The Sutherland design incorporates the “sixth generation” suite of starship technologies pioneered by the Reliant class into a much larger survey cruiser, with an emphasis on modernizing its defensive systems in addition to adding the latest research facilities.",

    "Species.aenar.description": "An offshoot of Andorians, the Aenar are a telepathic species whose lack of sight is compensated by their enhanced senses and telepathic abilities. Once thought to be a myth, the Aenar prefer their solitude and live in shielded communities far from their fellow Andorians. Though they are few in number, the Aenar are highly valued for their sensory capabilities. The Andorian government has granted them some degree of sovereignty to manage their own matters. While most prefer to stick to the polar icecaps of their homeworld, some Aenar have left Andoria to pursue careers in Starfleet or other efforts. Known for possessing a fascination with technology, some have gone on to become valued engineers.",

Though typically blind, they are telepathic, and their other senses are heightened. Once believed to be a myth, the Aenar are few and most prefer to remain within their isolated settlements, and they rarely bother themselves with matters outside their own communities. They lack the distinctive blue skin pigmentation of other Andorians, instead having skin tones that range from white, to ice blue, to pale gray. Aenar deplore violence, and commonly follow a strictly pacifist ideology.\n\nCompared to their Andorian kin, Aenar often seem calm and restrained. They are no less proud of their heritage, but they express that pride differently, often taking great pride in their skills and the work they do.

    "Species.aenar.soloDescription": "The Aenar were a subspecies of Andorians who were on the verge of extinction by the mid-22nd century. They had two antennae and no skin or hair pigmentation. Their most distinctive trait was their telepathic abilities, which included reading minds and psychically projecting themselves into the minds of other humanoids.",
    "Species.aenar.trait": "Aenar",
    "Species.aenar.traitDescription": "Though biologically similar to Andorians, Aenar have developed their own culture and abilities that make them distinct from their cousins. Though many consider their lack of ability to see a hindrance, the Aenar possess senses that allow them to read text with their fingers and are able to tell distances based on how far away something sounds to them. Their telepathic capabilities make them highly valued by other species as well, and with technological aid some are able to project their thoughts over vast distances. Some Aenar have a sardonic view of the world while others seem to be filled with endless curiosity about what they can experience outside of their communes.",
    "Species.aenar.traitDescription2e": "Biologically similar to Andorians, Aenar differ in a number of ways. Aenar are typically blind, but their other senses are heightened to a degree that more than compensates for their lack of sight. They are also telepathic which further contributes to their awareness of their environment. Aenar are typically pacifists, and thus may be reluctant, or even outright refuse, to carry out violent acts.",

    "Species.andorian.name": "Andorian",
    "Species.andorian.aboutNames": "Andorian names tend to be somewhat harsh-sounding, and have a personal name followed by a clan name. Amongst some Andorians, it’s common to begin the clan name with a gender-specific prefix: 'zh' or 'sh' for females, and 'ch' or 'th' for males. This is placed before the family name, separated by an apostrophe. Longer or more complicated Andorian names are commonly shortened, especially when dealing with other species. Examples: Ishrelia zh’Azonan (female), Atheth th’Zynes(male)",
    "Species.andorian.description": "An aggressive, passionate people from the frozen moon Andoria, the Andorians have been part of the United Federation of Planets since its foundation, having been firm allies of Humanity for several years beforehand.

    "Species.aquan.aboutNames": "Aquan names are typically a single word composed of just a few syllables.",
    "Species.aquan.description": "The humanoid, water-breathing Aquans were transformed indigenous inhabitants of the planet Argo. They had green skin, flat noses, hair resembling kelp, webbed hands, and fins on their ankles. Argo was once mostly land, but planetary-wide seismic disturbances caused the land to gradually sink into the sea. Though not everyone chose the procedure, the medically advanced Aquans developed drugs to turn themselves into an aquatic species. Although they had the means to reverse the transformation, once they became water breathers, they chose to forget their past and construct a new society beneath the sea.\n\nThe reversal formula was lost to time, and the remaining air breathers were seen as enemies. Among the water-breathing Aquans’ many medical talents were the manipulation and erasure of memories, which they used on their enemies.\n\nIn 2269, the _Enterprise_ was studying Argo, unaware of any intelligent life on the planet, when a catastrophic seaquake put Kirk and Spock in peril of drowning.\n\nFortunately, they were saved by some of the Aquans and transformed into sea-breathers. With the help of the Aquans, they were able to find a way to reverse the transformation, and some younger Aquans chose to also use the drug so they could experience life on the surface of their world.\n\nToday, both groups of Aquans live in peace on Argo, and within a year of first contact, a handful of Aquans, both air and water breathers, joined Starfleet.",

    "Species.arbazan.soloDescription": "Like many Humanoid species within the Federation, the Arbazan are physically similar to Humans, though the forward portion of their skulls have slightly raised plates that reinforce their brows. Arbazan have been Federation members since shortly after its founding and are found throughout Federation space, often serving as ambassadors, attaches, advisors, and negotiators – though there have also been several well-known scientific discoveries and engineering advancements by dedicated Arbazan.",

    "Species.arcadian.aboutNames": "Arcadians tend to have a given name and surname. Being aquatic in nature, they have a long, flowing name delivered as a series of clicks and melodic music, though they try to have a name that is more easily understood by terrestrial beings. Arcadian names usually translate to something peaceful or beautiful, such as “Melody” or “Windsong.” Arcadians who choose more sinister translations of their names are considered to be outliers among the pacifistic species.",
    "Species.arcadian.description": "The Federation’s philosophy of bringing peace between species across the Galaxy is embraced fervently by the pacifistic Arcadians. An aquatic species, the Arcadians believe that violence desecrates the great gift of life their species has been endowed with. The Arcadians’ brains are structured so that they are capable of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and they are often able to learn foreign languages astonishingly fast. The Arcadians are able to survive outside of water for great periods of time but find doing so physically taxing. Their dedication to peace means their homeworld has been conquered several times over the years, and the rich dilithium mines and precious ores beneath their oceans make their world a tempting target by those not swayed by their pleas for peace.",
    "Species.arcadian.exampleValue": "Peace Is an Ideal Worth Dying For",
    "Species.arcadian.traitDescription": "The Arcadians have developed an advanced culture that resolves its problems through the use of applied logic. If two individuals cannot come to an agreement, they rely upon a complex legal system to settle the dispute. The Arcadians accept that violence is a sad constant in the universe but refuse to add to the problems it causes. This does not mean they will refuse to serve on Starfleet vessels; the Arcadians rationalize this by saying they will use defensive systems to protect their comrades and enjoy using the Federation’s advanced technology to assist them in exploring the quadrant.",

    "Species.ariolo.aboutNames": "Ariolo usually use just one given name. They belong to large extended families on their homeworld and may give their harras, or herd name, to denote which part of their home planet they are from.",
    "Species.ariolo.description": "The Ariolo stand out in a crowd, and it is not just because they are a species who evolved to run on four legs. Resembling the centaur from Earth mythology, the Ariolo are a species who have learned to adapt to the Federation’s bipedal society. As natural athletes, they have a proud tradition of engaging in sports such as jousting and archery. Their homeworld is a verdant paradise they have maintained by moving their heavy industries and atomic plants off-world into orbital space stations.

    "Species.ariolo.traitDescription": "The Ariolo are a species of keen intellects and possess physical traits that give them an advantage over most of their neighbors, and they possess great patience and an unwillingness to ruin the natural environment. They do not possess more advanced technology than the Vulcans or Andorians but easily possess more patience.

Though they are known for being mercenaries, the Betelgeusians have a strict code of honor where they will honor their contracts to the letter but refuse to engage in dishonorable cruelty.

The Borg meld biology with technology, and a drone will have countless implants, the result of both invasive surgery and aggressive nanotechnology. As of 2371, only a single individual has ever been removed from the Borg Collective — Jean-Luc Picard, who was captured only days earlier, meaning that his implants were less extensive than those of someone assimilated years or decades before.

    "Species.bynar.description": "Bynars are native to the planet Bynaus, in the Beta Magellan system. Shorter than Humans, Bynars have lilac-coloured skin, enlarged skulls, and asymmetrical ears. Their defining characteristic is that the entire Bynar race is cyborgs connected to their master computer on their homeworld, allowing them to near-instantaneously share information. Bynars work and live in pairs, being genetically bonded to another for life. Pairs of Bynars communicate using complex binary code. When they do speak other languages, they alternate phrases and finishing each other’s sentences. If one of the pair dies, it’s traditional for the survivor to return to Bynaus to be paired with a new Bynar. \n\nBynar that choose not to return are seen to have rejected Bynar society and have their personal identification code removed from the computer network. The Bynars’ constant exposure to computers makes them quick to learn new operating systems and programs, and their ability to recall data and process new information makes them highly valued to organizations such as the Starfleet Corps of Engineers and the Daystrom Institute. \n\nBynars have practiced their cybernetic augmentation for centuries: as early as the 2150s they began replacing the parietal lobes of newborns with a synaptic processor. Bynar workers and security forces once employed supplementary physical augmentations, but these have become rare since Bynaus allied with the Federation. Initially, Bynars seldom traveled far from their homeworld, as the range of their network was limited. By the late 2200s, subspace  communication had improved enough that they could travel throughout much of the Federation.",
    "Species.bynar.soloDescription": "Over time their interconnection with their world’s master computer has grown to the point that their language and thought patterns have become as close to binary as is possible for organic beings. In fact, their very lives depend on this interaction with their master computer, as well as with one another. They are shorter in height than most humanoids, genderless with lilac skin and enlarged skulls, and usually operate in pairs.",
    "Species.bynar.traitDescription": "Despite their small size, Bynars are physical robust and durable. Their augmentations allow them to communicate instantaneously with their twin while in the same system, sharing all sensory input.

    "Species.cardassian.description2e": "Often vilified and distrusted due to the actions of their government, Cardassians have a reputation for being ruthless, deceitful, and aggressive. Due to a dearth of natural resources and an economic collapse, Cardassian culture was overtaken by an oppressive authoritarian regime dominated by the military, which began a decades-long campaign of expansion, conquest, and exploitation, including the occupation of Bajor and a lengthy border conflict with the Federation. In the aftermath of the Dominion War, with the military government overthrown, the rebuilding of Cardassia was a difficult process, not least because of long-held feelings of resentment towards the Cardassians.\n\nCardassians are a creative, dedicated people, with a strong cultural fascination with intrigue.

While they cannot become energy, a Changeling’s ability to assume other forms is limited more by skill and experience than by physical capacity: it is theorized that they transfer mass to and from subspace to change size and density. Many Changelings find themselves persecuted by “solids” for their shapeshifting ability, and often crave a sense of order and justice in the universe, with a rigid attitude at odds with their fluid forms.",

Owing to a long gestation process and having suffered greatly in wars with the Tellarities and other species, the Coridanites’ low population makes their worlds ripe for plunder by more aggressive neighbors. This has led the average Coridanite to be suspicious of others, but once their loyalty is earned, it is hard to shake.",
    "Species.coridanite.exampleValue": "At Last We Can Speak for Our Own Needs",
    "Species.coridanite.traitDescription": "The Coridanites are known for three things: their technological superiority, their shrewd negotiating tactics, and their paranoia at the notion of being manipulated by outsiders. They struggle to accept outsiders’ intentions as genuine and will often commune among themselves to discuss the actions of others. The Coridanites are far from weak, and their fleet of fast and well-armed vessels has made many would-be conquerors regret their mistakes. This has given the Coridanites a sense of pride in their culture and filled them with the belief that they will persevere against all others.",

    "Species.elAurian.name": "El-Aurian",
    "Species.elAurian.description": "A species of “listeners” originating in the El-Aurian system, The El-Aurians were a well-traveled species of humanoids who visited many parts of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Some El-Aurians had even visited Earth during the 19th century before humanity even knew of their existence. In the mid-23rd century, the El-Aurian race was the victim of a massive Borg invasion, with all but a small fraction of El-Aurians being assimilated or killed and the entire civilization destroyed. The loss of their home world scattered the survivors across the galaxy. By the 24th century few El-Aurians remain and with no established civilization or home wander as nomads of the galaxy. Few of these survivors have even taken up a career in Starfleet, hoping to find a community they lost so long ago.",
    "Species.elAurian.exampleValue": "I told you, I listen",
    "Species.elAurian.traitDescription": "This species are masters of the art of listening. They understand that listening is an active skill, and involves taking into consideration such things as body language, tone of voice, as well as the words that other beings are speaking. El-Aurians may use this trait to reduce the Difficulty of Social Interaction Tasks. El-Aurians know that time is on their side, they never really feel a need to rush. When performing an Extended Task, an El-Aurian may make one free Re-Roll Work without a spend of Momentum. Since they destroyed the El-Aurian home world, most El-Aurians are distrustful of or outright hate the Borg.",

    "Species.ferengi.name": "Ferengi",
    "Species.ferengi.aboutNames": "Ferengi tend to have only a single name, which tend to be only one or two syllables, though exceptions exist. Among cultures who have family names, Ferengi will occasionally refer to themselves as “son of...,” “daughter of...,” “child of...,” and so forth, but as each Ferengi is expected to make their own way in life, family names are unheard of among Ferengi.",
    "Species.ferengi.description2e": "An acquisitive species native to Ferenginar, the Ferengi are unimposing beings, known mostly as merchants and traders. Their culture promotes the accumulation of material wealth, and their society is capitalistic, with most routine activities accompanied by an exchange of money, typically in the form of gold-pressed latinum (a non-rep- licable liquid metal, suspended within “slips,” “strips,” “bars,” and “bricks” of gold). Ferengi society is strongly patriarchal, with female Ferengi traditionally disallowed from owning property or even wearing clothing (and male Ferengi often having deeply unpleasant attitudes towards non-Ferengi women), though these attitudes start to change by the late 24th century.\n\nFerengi pride themselves on their ability to acquire wealth, though there are many different approaches to this. For centuries, Ferengi culture has been domi- nated by the philosophies and lessons of the Rules of Acquisition, though these can be interpreted in a variety of different ways and applied to a Ferengi’s life.",
    "Species.ferengi.traitDescription2e": "Ferengi physiology does not lend itself to physical activity, nor does their culture value such hardship, though they have a resistance to many common diseases. Ferengi have exceptional hearing, and highly sensitive ears, though this also means that intense sounds (and physical force applied to the ears) can inflict debilitating pain. Their unusual brain structure means that telepaths cannot read Ferengi minds. Ferengi regard the accumulation of wealth as the highest virtue, and while this has given them a reputation as cunning negotiators, they are also often seen as duplicitous and manipulative.",
    "Species.ferengi.soloDescription": "An enterprising people devoted to applying their considerable technology toward the acquisition of wealth. Encountered by Starfleet in 2364 and forming a wide variety of relationships to the Federation, being organized as a collection of private businesses.

    "Species.gorn.name": "Gorn",
    "Species.gorn.soloDescription": "Gorn are large and powerfully-built, even more so than other famously-mighty species such as the Klingons or Nausicaans. They are many times stronger than a Human being, and resilient enough to ignore massive blunt force trauma or even short periods in hard vacuum. However, Gorn are not especially agile or fast. Gorn are ectothermic – cold- blooded – with their body temperature varying by external factors, and thus favor warm environments where they can be most active and effective.",

    "Species.hologram.name": "Hologram",
    "Species.hologram.soloDescription": "Holograms can be programmed to any specification, though the nature of their holomatrix means that they are essentially impervious to direct physical harm – they can allow energy and objects to pass through them at will. However, they are unable to go anywhere that lacks holographic emitters that can project their image and forcefields, and those emitters can be damaged even if the holograms themselves cannot. Holograms also tend not to receive much respect or consideration from flesh- and-blood people, who may see them as tools at best or annoyances at worst. While the majority of holograms are no more sentient than a character in a holo-novel, under the right circumstances, they can become self-aware and deserve the same rights as any biological sentient life-form. Holograms may also have a second species trait, reflecting the species they were designed to emulate.",

    "Species.human.description": "Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to forge alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.",
    "Species.human.description2e": "Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a hardy and ambitious species, who went from the brink of mutual annihilation to a united peace- ful society in less than a century. A century after that, humanity had established itself as part of an interplane- tary alliance, the United Federation of Planets, bringing former rivals together as allies. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature—sometimes strongly emo- tional and passionate like Klingons or Andorians, yet at others highly analytical and rational like Tellarites or Vulcans—which has allowed them to grow beyond their warlike and fractious past, but their capacity for ambition and aggression are as much a part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.\n\nHumans tend to draw upon two sets of cultural values. As a central and founding member of the Federation, the traditions and ideals of the Federation (or even those of Starfleet) are often regarded as synonymous with “Human culture” (though the Federation draws a lot from each of its members), to the point where nobody is entirely sure where Earth ends and the Federation begins. Yet, conversely, this can also lead to Humans finding value in preserving the traditions and cultures of their pre-warp ancestors.",

The Hupyrians are closely allied with the Ferengi, and their homeworld is the source of Hupyrian beetle snuff. They have tight skin with wrinkles around their eyes and mouths that give them a constant frowning expression. They are known for their devotion in service, and some will take a vow of silence where they are only permitted to speak to their masters. They are often found as bodyguards and food tasters.",
    "Species.hupyrian.traitDescription": "Hupyrians are taller than most species, and their size alone can be intimidating. They are loyal especially when working in the employ of another, and take vows seriously.",

Their tall, strong physiques, sharp teeth, and the distinctive dense crest that runs from their brow, over their heads, and down their spines, all contribute to an appearance that is synonymous with martial prowess and ferocity. Hardy and aggressive, Klingons combine a sense of pride and personal conviction with a fatalistic streak, regarding honorable death to be preferable to what they would deem a shameful or cowardly life.\n\nKlingons embrace life and death alike without fear. They are also a people with a powerful sense of honor, both personal and familial, and they are quick to anger when attacked; the greatest slights can result in generations-long blood feuds.",
    "Species.klingon.soloDescription": "A proud, warrior species centered in the Beta Quadrant. There is a great redundancy in Klingon organs, with two livers, multiple stomachs, three lungs, and an eight-chambered heart.

    "Species.megarite.name": "Megarite",
    "Species.megarite.aboutNames": "Megarites tend to have a given name and surname, though often use only their given name. Most Megarite names are drawn from musical compositions considered important to the individual’s parents, as music is considered not just an important part of Megarite culture but also plays a key role in how they communicate with each other.",
    "Species.megarite.description": "Seeing a Megarite outside of their homeworld is a rare occurrence as this species’ strict dietary requirements means they prefer to stay home. Possessing a thick hide capable of keeping them warm in the frigid waters of their home, the Megarites are considered some of the finest minds in the field of aquatic engineering. The Federation Science Council will often consult experts when attempting to build aquatic enclosures and reinforcing Cetacean research labs aboard Starfleet vessels. The Megarites are a greatly poetic people, and will often spend their downtime composing lyrical ballads and poems of such beauty that they are renowned throughout the quadrant. Their biology can only process the proteins of the aquatic life of their homeworld, so Megarites rely upon nutrient injections when traveling away from Megarus.",
    "Species.megarite.exampleValue": "As Swift as the Tide, As Strong as the Glacier",
    "Species.megarite.traitDescription": "Megarites believe that every moment should be appreciated for what it is. Their thick hides protect them from most threats, which leads Megarites to take risks if it means they can accomplish their tasks. Though Megarites prefer to keep to themselves, they become energetic when others have similar interests as them, and one of the greatest gifts they can give another is a custom poem composed in their honor.",

    "Species.nausicaan.name": "Nausicaan",
    "Species.nausicaan.traitDescription": "Nausicaans are a tall, very strong species hailing from Nausicaa. They are generally stronger than an average Human, though often somewhat less intelligent, preferring brute force over finesse and direct methods as opposed to subtlety. They have little patience for organized forms of government, though they will tolerate following a captain for as long as that captain earns their capricious loyalty. Nausicaans are somewhat resistant to pain and injury, and almost never back down from a challenge, especially when it involves games that carry the potential for serious bodily harm to themselves or their opponents.",

    "Species.orion.name": "Orion",
    "Species.orion.description2e": "A species with a colorful reputation, the Orions are subject to rumor, speculation, and flights of fancy, to the point where there are numerous common misconceptions about their species and culture. This seems to be at least partially by design. Orions are accustomed to taking full advantage of any opportunity that passes their way, and the uncertainty and misdirection that surrounds them is a considerable advantage. The influence of Orion traders and the Orion Syndicate can be felt across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, often in ways that flout the laws of other cultures, and often employing agents of other species.\n\nOrion culture appears to be divided along gender lines, and there is evidence to suggest they have a broadly matriarchal culture, with the women serving in leadership roles, while Orion males more often serving as muscle, laborers, and minor operatives, though this has shifted somewhat over the centuries. This appears to be due to a trait of some Orion females, who have been observed to produce pheromones that can make male Orions (and males of some other species, including Humans) compliant. It isn’t known how widespread this trait is.",
    "Species.orion.traitDescription2e": "Orions have similar environmental tolerances to Humans and are physically and culturally well-accustomed to interstellar travel. The Orions’ reputation as thieves, pirates, and illicit traders can make others wary of them, but it can also open doors and create opportunities in more unsavory parts of the Galaxy.",

    "Species.pandronian.aboutNames": "Typical Pandronian names are composed of three short parts. It’s possible for individuals to disassemble from one individual and reassemble with other organisms to form a new Pandronian, which requires a new name.",
    "Species.pandronian.description": "Pandronians are one of the most surreal sentient beings the Federation has ever encountered. They have the appearance of a light-green-skinned humanoid, but each Pandronian is actually three creatures in one, existing as a cooperative group of distinct organisms. The organisms that make up a Pandronian colony can change over time, merging with other colonies and ending the existence of the previous colony, creating new, unique Pandronians. They are, in some way, like Trill symbionts, with colony members taking the knowledge of former colonies with them when they form new unity.\n\nThe concept of individuality holds an idiosyncratic meaning for a Pandronian. In language, this is expressed by using “this one” instead of “I.” Many Pandronians see single-entity beings as inferior and may appear cold and arrogant, but while disagreeable, they are not dangerous, abhorring violence and finding it a moral failing. Even in self-defense, they would rather ‘disassemble unity’ than fight.\n\nOutside of Pandronian cities is a vast jungle of constantly changing colony creatures, some quite dangerous. Consequently, Pandronians don’t travel at night or go far from home. This is so deeply ingrained it follows a Pandronian off-planet.",
    "Species.pandronian.exampleValue": "This one does not demean itself with the use of casual violence",
    "Species.pandronian.traitDescription": "Pandronians consist of discreet organisms that form a single colony creature. This gives the species a unique understanding of the concept of individuality and allows them to take part in multiple scenes simultaneously.",

    "Species.phylosian.name": "Phylosian",
    "Species.phylosian.aboutNames": "Phylosian names are generally a single word and do not reflect familial ties or concepts of gender.",
    "Species.phylosian.description": "Despite their plant-like appearance, the Phylosians are intelligent beings with a complex culture and society. They have a unique physical appearance, lacking a traditional head and instead possessing a rounded mass resembling the top of an asparagus spear. Their sense organs are located in the form of a pair of eyestalks, but they lack visible eyes, mouths, or ears. Their bodies consist of a series of furry, vine-like extensions that are bunched near the bottom and equipped with four leg-like projections for movement.\n\nCommunication is accomplished with the help of a device called a voder which interprets the low- frequency sound waves their veins make. They can communicate with other Phylosians without the voder and at great distances when on the ground.\n\nPhylosians can be long-lived and, like the great redwood trees of Earth, can grow very tall (up to 8 meters or more). However, if living in a confined area, such as a starship, that growth is stunted.\n\nAll of Phylos has been greatly influenced by Stavos Keniclius, a 21st-century Augment who inadvertently triggered a staphylococcus plague when he arrived on the planet, significantly damaging the planet’s ecosystem and nearly annihilating the Phylosian civilization. Despite that tragedy, they remained peaceful.\n\nAs of 2270, a few Phylosians had already joined Starfleet as experts in exobotany and medicine.",
    "Species.phylosian.traitDescription": "Phylosians are sentient plants that have achieved a high level of technological sophistication. They have no mouths, requiring them to use technological means to communicate verbally. Their bodies are composed of a greenish trunk with many stalks protruding from the torso to act as arms and legs.

    "Species.romulan.description": "Romulans are similar, but not quite identical, to Vulcans, having diverged from their common ancestors, though they did not adopt the stoicism and logic of their cousins. Rather, Romulans are a cruel and ruthless people, quick to anger, and easily moved to emotion. A culture of military discipline seems to keep their worst members directed towards useful ends, though paranoia and self-interest motivate Romulan politics as much as a desire for collective benefit; at times, it seems that the only things keeping the Romulan Star Empire together are the fact that they despise other species more than they despise one another.",
    "Species.romulan.description2e": "A divergent offshoot of the Vulcan species, Romulans fled their original homeworld millennia ago. These Vulcans, “those who marched beneath the Raptor’s wings,” refused to accept the teachings of Surak, and thus did not embrace logic or stoicism, and eventually their ships would reach the worlds known as Romulus and Remus. Much of what is known about the Romulans has been pieced together from secondary and tertiary sources, as the Romulans themselves are secretive bordering on paranoia and do not disclose any information about themselves unless they deem it vital. Indeed, the Federation didn’t even know what Romulans looked like until a century after the Earth-Romulan War.\n\nTo the Romulans, trust is something to be placed in only a few, for misplaced trust can be a deadly weapon. A Romulan trusts only their closest family members, and places increasing layers of secrecy, obfuscation, and misdirection as relationships grow more distant. There are exceptions to this, such as the scrupulously candid order _Qowat Milat_, but most Romulans are highly guarded and suspicious of everyone.",
    "Species.romulan.traitDescription": "Romulan physiology is not meaningfully different to that of Vulcans, though a portion of the Romulan species exhibits a v-shaped forehead ridge not evident in Vulcans. The largest difference is that Romulans lack the intense mental discipline common to Vulcans. Psychologically and culturally, Romulans prize cunning and strength of will, and are distrustful of other species: this opinion is reciprocated, as Romulans have a reputation for manipulation, deception, and betrayal.",
    "Species.romulan.traitDescription2e": "Romulan physiology is like that of Vulcans, but subtly different in a variety of ways, enough to cause difficulties in using medical techniques designed for Vulcans, and enough that, with difficulty, sensors can distinguish between Vulcan and Romulan life-signs. Psychologically and culturally, Romulans prize cunning and strength of will, and are highly distrustful of outsiders. Romulans have a reputation for manipulation, deception, and betrayal.",

    "Species.skorr.description": "Bipedal avians with feathered wings, the Skorr was a splinter group of Aurelians that left their planet nearly a millennia ago to pursue a warrior way of life, pitting clan against clan.\n\nDue to their limited genetic population, the Skorr relied on cloning in their early history to support reproduction. This eventually led to the Skorr military’s ability to rapidly produce large armies. Extraordinarily long-lived, they also have an extraordinarily short childhood, reaching the equivalent of a Terran teenager in only two years.\n\nAround the time Zefram Cochran was discovering warp drive, a Skorr spiritual leader named Alar led his people into an era of peace. Before he died, his brain patterns were imprinted into a piece of sculpture called “The Soul of Alar.” Not unlike a Vulcan Katric ark, it allowed others to experience his essence, keeping the literal spirit of peace alive.\n\nTwo hundred years later, the peace had held and opened the doors for their entry into the Federation.

In truth, this comes from a sense of intellec- tual honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept or person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and enjoy arguing, and the criticisms, complaints, and insults issued during conversations are intended to be met in kind: to do otherwise is to display a weak character, an inability to stand up for oneself, or an unwillingness to confront one’s own flaws.",

    "Species.trill.description": "The Trill species, from their homeworld of the same name, appear almost identical to Humans, but for rows of spots running down the sides of their bodies, from head to toe. However, this superficial similarity conceals a considerable difference — the Trill are capable of bonding with a symbiotic organism known as a symbiont, creating a distinct being from the two individual creatures. The symbionts can live for many centuries, and are placed with successive hosts, carrying the memories and knowledge of previous hosts into a new joining with each new generation. This fact isn’t widely known outside the Trill themselves, but it isn’t a secret — it simply isn’t widely discussed, and the number of joined Trill is relatively small. The Trill have been part of the Federation for well over a century, with several renowned Trill serving important roles in shaping the Federation.

There are relatively few of this second species, species, but they are extremely intelligent and capable of living for centuries.\n\nWhile not a secret, it is not widely discussed that a small portion of humanoid Trill are capable of bonding with the invertebrates, commonly referred to as symbionts, and in this bond—called a Joining—creates a gestalt person, a combination of the minds, memories, and personalities of both creatures. While a symbiont cannot be removed without killing its host, upon a host’s death, a symbiont will be passed to a new host, preserving knowledge and memory over generations.\n\nTrill society has been shaped by the Joined, with Trill culture tending to take a long view of social development, and pursuing intellectual and philosophical development over interpersonal conflict. The Trill are a firm and dedicated member of the Federation.",

    "Species.trill.traitDescription": "Trill are especially resilient to parasites, as a quirk of their potential to be Joined; Joined Trill are entirely immune to parasitic infection. However, they tend to have strong allergic reactions to insect bites and other forms of venom, which can disrupt their neurochemistry, particularly if they’re Joined. As many of the specifics of Trill physiology — especially with regards to symbiosis — are not widely known, this can result in medical complications.",

However, they tend to have strong allergic reactions to insect bites and other venoms, which can disrupt their neurochemistry, especially if they are Joined.

    "Species.tzenkethi.name": "Tzenkethi",
    "Species.tzenkethi.description": "Aggressive and territorial, the Tzenkethi Coalition is led by a ruler known as the Autarch. The Tzenkethi government is a kratocracy, and the Autarch retains their position for as long as they can hold onto power, which transitions via coups. Under the Autarch are a series of appointed ministers, known as Tzelnira, whose job is to maintain order during shifts of power. The Tzenkethi have a well-earned reputation for pragmatism and ruthlessness, with mercy only being granted to those who earn it. Tzenkethi have little respect for weakness or frailty, but acknowledge cunning as a variant form of strength. Early in the 24th Century, the Tzenkethi engaged in several skirmishes with the Klingon Empire and even fought a border war against the Federation. Following these defeats, the Tzenkethi withdrew behind their borders, participating in little diplomacy for the better part of a century. The Tzenkethi retain lingering animosity over their war with the Federation, and the Coalition engages in regular propaganda that paints the United Federation of Planets as immoral: a source of chaos, dissidents, and illicit chemicals. The Tzenkethi government considers the Federation’s method of government—where all members and people have a voice—as tantamount to anarchy, and view Federation values as subversive. All Tzenkethi who leave their home world heavily armoured, with soldiers wearing defensive body armour with build-in weaponry and equipment. Specialists have additional equipment built into their armour, such as sensors, surgical equipment, or heavy mortars.",

    "Species.tzenkethi.traitDescription": "This Trait may reduce the Difficulty of Tasks requiring (extreme) flexibility. When not in combat or stressful situations, they naturally regenerate at extremely fast speeds as long as they have at least 1 Stress. Tzenkethi are singularly focused on excellence and moving up the Echelons, therefore they will do anything they can in order to complete the task ahead of them and succeed, even if this means dying in the process. Other Tzenkethi authority figures are holy to them and they would never go against direct orders. Due to a history of dealing with alien invaders the Tzenkethi are extremely mistrustful of aliens and believe they are without morals.",

    "Species.vulcan.description": "The Vulcans are a stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, in truth the Vulcans feel deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Their stoicism comes from a culture of logic and self- discipline, where emotions are analyzed and dissected to rob them of their potency, so that they cannot overwhelm or control the individual. Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst outsiders.",
    "Species.vulcan.description2e": "The first species to contact Humans, Vulcans are stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, Vulcans in fact feel emotions deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Ancient Vulcans were prone to murderous rage and fits of paranoia, and nearly destroyed themselves millennia ago, before Surak taught logic and the purging of emotion. His teachings led to peace among the Vulcans and the establishment of a culture driven by reason.\n\nVulcans embrace science and logic, but their lives are not purely devoted to such things: they have a deeply philosophical and spiritual side, with art and music as vital to their culture as logic.

They are also telepathic, though this takes training to properly manifest, and they learn mental discipline and emotional control from childhood. However, this control takes regular meditation to maintain, and their controlled nature and desire for privacy can distance them from others, and make interactions awkward.",
    "Species.vulcan.traitDescription2e": "Vulcans have a naturally high tolerance for extremes of heat, are resistant to dehydration, and can shield their eyes from blinding light with a set of secondary eyelids. Their auditory and olfactory senses are extremely keen, and the gravity of their homeworld means an average Vulcan is about three times as strong as a Human of similar size and weight. Vulcans are innately telepathic, and through extensive training since childhood, Vulcan minds can suppress their emotional responses, and even exert influence upon biological pro- cesses, though this takes regular meditation to maintain.",
